## Getting Started

### 1. Setting up Accounts
 1. Create [github accounts](https://github.com/)
 1. send me your usernames so I can add you to the collaborators list  

### 2. Github App
1. Download & Install [Github Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/)
1. set up default cli and editor ``File>Options>Advanced``

### 3.  Checking Dependencies
1. Using Your Terminal on mac or git bash on pc  
1. check if git is installed ``git --version`` if not install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
1. check if node is installed ``node --version`` or ``npm --version`` Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### 4. Initial Build Process

1. Clone Repository
1. Open CLI at ``dscvr/src/`` or using Github ``cmd + ` `` then ``cd src``
 1. enter ``npm install``
 1. enter``npm run build --watch``
1. Using Github ``cmd + shift + A`` ``Repository>Open in Editor Name``

_once your editor of choice is open you are ready to work on the project._

### 5. Verify Functionality
Once you've followed the Steps, verify if it worked by **[Viewing the Demo](demo.html)** The result should look colorful and obviously styled.

**Note:** _if either this page or the demo page look un-styled. that means you have not run your build yet or there is an issue preventing the build_


### 6. Working on the project
1. Open github Desktop and open terminal
1. In terminal Enter `cd src` to move to development folder
1. enter `npm run build --watch`
1. leave the terminal open while working
1.  `--watch` will auto update your changes to you the assets folder locally

### 7. Checking Out Branches

The `origin/master` branch is the main production branch. with this project we will divide up work as Individual _Features_ or _Tasks_ There Are a few things you need to do, before you begin working on a feature. from this point on Everyone else needs to be working on the Dev Branch.

1. Check the project board for tasks to complete, place your chosen task in the `in progress` stack.
1. move to the dev branch from Github Desktop or from your code editor
1. If Your Feature doesn't have a branch yet create one. You can do so in the Github Desktop Application.
1. switch to your code editor and in the lower corner there should be a line that says the name of the current branch.
1. If it's correct, you're all set.
