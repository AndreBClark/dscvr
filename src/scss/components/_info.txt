What are components?

Components are often used in the context of a module, also referred to as
"module-components". But in this context these are "utility-components".
Utility-components do not belong to a module. They are for a global use-case
such as buttons, labels, or headings.


Here we might override some vendor provided utility components or create some
of our own. A common vendor override is changing the colors for buttons or
labels. A common custom component is creating heading styles to visually
emulate h1-h6 to avoid using the native html heading tags for sizing purposes.
